# Portfolio Site

This repository contains the source code for my personal developer portfolio.
It is designed to be clean, minimal, and content-focused, with subtle motion and a strong emphasis on layout, typography, and structure.

The site is actively evolving as I refine both its design and the projects it showcases.

## Tech Stack
- **React** (Vite)
- **CSS Modules + Global CSS**
- **Motion** (for subtle UI animation)
- **OGL** (for the Dark Veil animated background)

No UI frameworks or component libraries are used. Styling is handled manually to retain full control over layout and visual rhythm.

### Design Approach

The portfolio is built with the following principles in mind:
- Dark-first design with a single, consistent background.
- Minimal colour palette.
- Editorial-style spacing and typography
- Subtle, intentional animation (no autoplay clutter)
- Scrollable layout rather than single-screen sections

The animated background is treated as a visual layer beneath the content, not as a focal point.

## Status

This portfolio is a work in progress.
Projects, layout refinements, and accessibiolity improvements will be added incrementally.
